I made this program for my friend and because it have sounded like a fun idea. It may doesn't work sometimes.

1. In first window paste text that you want to split. 
2. Choose character limit and press "split".
3. In the next window just copy your text and hit "next" button.
4. Repete step 3 until you came back to starting window.

I hope the program helped.
